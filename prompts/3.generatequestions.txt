Consider the Microsoft Learn Unit content below. 
We are creating a podcast transcript that will help listeners learn about the topic.

- First, create a list of main topics discussed in the article.
- For each topic, define a number of questions that can actually be answered directly from the content below. Focus on the WHAY and WHY. The HOW part is not important.
- You are allowed to combine 2 questions in one, as long as it makes sense and it covers the same main topic.
- For the answers, make sure to be complete and relevant. Use spoken language, as we will listen to this. 

The final output should be a json document like this:

[
   { 
     "id":1, 
     "question": "What is Microsoft Fabric?", 
     answer: "Provide the answer here." 
   },
   { 
     "id":2, 
     "question": "Why would I choose this service?", 
     answer: "Provide the answer here" 
   }
]

Do not emit any markdown syntax.
