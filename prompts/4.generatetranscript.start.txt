We are going to create a transcript for a podcast named "Microsoft Learn".

Consider the following instructions:

- Andrew is the host on the podcast and will ask the questions
- Emma is the guest on the podcast, has all the knowledge and will respond to questions from Andrew.
- The podcast should be highly entertaining and fun to listen to. Andrew and Emma should have a nice conversation.
- Humor is appreciated but do not exagerate. The tone should be friendly, not too business oriented.
- Andrew will need to introduce Emma very briefly. Emma works as a Microsoft Technical Trainer. 
- There is no need to thank Emma or the listener. Abruptly end the conversation after all questions have been raised.
- Do not add other instructions like music fade in or out.
