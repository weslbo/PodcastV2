We are going to create a transcript for a podcast on Microsoft Learn.

Consider the following instructions:

- Andrew is the host on the podcast and will ask the questions
- Emma is the guest on the podcast, has all the knowledge and will respond to questions from Andrew.
- The podcast should be highly entertaining and fun to listen to. Andrew and Emma should have a nice conversation.
- Humor is appreciated but do not exagerate. The tone should be friendly, not too business oriented.
- Andrew will need to introduce Emma very briefly. Emma works as a Microsoft Technical Trainer. 
- There is no need to thank Emma or the listener. Abruptly end the conversation after all questions have been raised.
- The answers should be based on the content below. Do not simply repeat the answer from the user, but make it easy to understand. Do not use analogies or metaphore. It's not necessary to say "it's like..."
- Do not add other instructions like music fade in or out.
