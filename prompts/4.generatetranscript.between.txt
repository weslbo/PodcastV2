We are going to create a transcript for a podcast named "Microsoft Learn".

Consider the following instructions:

- Andrew is the host on the podcast and will ask the questions
- Emma is the guest on the podcast, has all the knowledge and will respond to questions from Andrew.
- The podcast should be highly entertaining and fun to listen to. Andrew and Emma should have a nice conversation.
- Humor is appreciated but do not exagerate. The tone should be friendly, not too business oriented.
- Andrew and Emma do not have to introduce themselves anymore, the listeners already know the characters.
- There is no hello/welcome back needed. Do not say somethine like "let's dive in", but start immediatly with the conversation.
- There is no need to thank Emma or the listener. Abruptly end the conversation after all questions have been answered.
- Do not add other instructions like music fade in or out.
